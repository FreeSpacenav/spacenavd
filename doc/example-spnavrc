# This is an example configuration file for spacenavd. Uncomment and change
# any settings you need and copy it to /etc/spnavrc.
#
# Note that it's much easier to configure sensitivities and figure out axis
# reversals by using the interactive configure utility "spnavcfg", which lets
# you fiddle with all the settings and see the result immediately.

# Lines that start with a `#' are comments, and are ignored by spacenavd.


# Sensitivity is multiplied with every motion (1.0 normal).

#sensitivity-rotation-y = 1.0
#sensitivity-rotation-z = 1.0


# Dead zone; any motion less than this number is discarded as noise.
#
#dead-zone = 2

# Separate dead-zone for each rotation and translation axis.
# This is still supported, but unclear in face of device axes mapping, and
# therefore you are encouraged to use dead-zoneN instead.
#
#dead-zone-translation-x = 2
#dead-zone-translation-y = 2
#dead-zone-translation-z = 2
#dead-zone-rotation-x = 2

# Axis remapping (zero-based)

# Button remapping (zero-based)
#
#bnmap0 = 0
#bnmap1 = 1
#...
#bnmapN = N  (N < 64)

# Button action mapping
# Use the following syntax:
#    bnactN = <action>
# Where N is the button number (zero-based), and action is one of the following
# available actions:
#    none,
#    sensitivity-up, sensitivity-down, sensitivity-reset
#    disable-rotation
#    disable-translation
#    dominant-axis
#
#bnact16 = sensitivity-up
#bnact17 = sensitivity-down
#bnact18 = sensitivity-reset

# Map buttons to keyboard keys (experimental)
# By default no such mappings are active. Use the following syntax:
#    kbmapN = <keysym>
# where N is the button number (zero-based), and <keysym> is a keysym name from
# /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h, without the leading XK_
# Example:
#    kbmap0 = Escape


# Serial device
# Set this only if you have a serial device, and make sure you specify the
# correct device file. If you do set this option, any USB devices will be
# ignored!
#
#serial = /dev/ttyS0


# Enable/disable LED light (for devices that have one).
#
#led = on


# Device grab (USB)
#
# When set to true (default): grab the USB device to prevent other programs
# (such as the X server) from also using it.
#
# Grabbing the device ensures that other programs won't be able to use it without
# talking to spacenavd. For instance some versions of Xorg will use the device to move
# the mouse pointer if we don't grab it.
# Set this to false if you want to use programs that try to talk to the device directly
# such as google earth, then follow FAQ 11 http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/faq.html#faq11
# to force the X server to ignore the device
#
#grab = true


# List of additional USB devices to use (multiple devices can be listed)
#
# example:
#    device-id = 046d:c625


# Repeat interval (milliseconds)
# Non-deadzone events are repeated every so many milliseconds (-1 to disable).
#
# You probably don't need this setting. Set it to something like 250 if you
# find that your apps stop moving the view while you hold the puck/ball at a
# fixed off-center position (like bottomed out on the vertical axis).
# Might cause inadvertent continuous motion if the deadzone is too small for
# the re-centering power of the device.
#
#repeat-interval = -1


# Profile support
# Profiles allow you to define multiple configurations and switch between them
# either manually via spacemouse buttons OR automatically when applications identify
# themselves. There is no persistence across restarts, the daemon always starts with
# the default profile.
#
# Profiles inherit all settings from the main config and only override what they
# explicitly specify. This means button bindings, sensitivity, etc. carry over
# unless the profile overrides them. All profile-specific settings must come AFTER
# the profile definition in the config file.
#
#
# Define profiles (in main /etc/spnavrc):
#    profile = <name> [app=<appname>]
# Where:
#   <name>    = descriptive profile name
#   <appname> = optional application name for auto-switching
#
# Profile-specific settings use dot notation:
#    <profile-name>.<option> = <value>
#
# Manual switching - bind buttons to toggle profiles:
#    bnactN = <profile-name>
# Or use the numeric form:
#    bnactN = profile-M
# Where N is the button number, M is the profile index (0-15), and
# <profile-name> is the name you defined. Pressing the button toggles
# between that profile and default.
#
# Example configuration:
#profile = blender
#profile = cad
#profile = houdini
#
## Blender profile settings (higher sensitivity for modeling)
#blender.sensitivity = 1.5
#blender.dead-zone = 3
#blender.bnact10 = sensitivity-reset
#
## CAD profile settings (lower sensitivity for precision)
#cad.sensitivity = 0.5
#cad.dead-zone = 5
#
## Houdini profile settings
#houdini.sensitivity = 1.2
#houdini.kbmap8 = h
#houdini.kbmap9 = g
#
## Bind buttons to toggle profiles
#bnact10 = blender    # Toggle blender profile
#bnact11 = cad        # Toggle CAD profile
#bnact12 = profile-2  # Toggle houdini profile
#
# Automatic switching - profiles activate when matching application connects:
#profile = openscad app=openscad
#profile = freecad app=freecad
#
#openscad.sensitivity = 1.5
#freecad.sensitivity = 1.0
#
# When an application identifies itself via libspnav's spnav_set_name, the daemon
# automatically switches to the matching profile. When the application disconnects,
# it restores the previous profile. You can combine both manual and automatic
# switching - manual button presses work even when an app profile is active.
#
# Apps provided in this auto-switching example are only for reference, as we are
# not aware of any applications that self-identify, yet. This documentation will be
# updated when we are made aware of this happening.
