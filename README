spacenavd - 0.6
---------------

1. About
  Spacenavd, is a free software replacement user-space driver (daemon), for
  3Dconnexion's space-something 6dof input devices. It's compatible with the
  original 3dxsrv proprietary daemon provided by 3Dconnexion, and works
  perfectly with any program that was written for the 3Dconnexion driver.

  For more info on the spacenav project, visit: http://spacenav.sourceforge.net


2. Dependencies
  In order to compile the spacenavd daemon, you'll need the following:
    * GNU C Compiler
    * GNU make
    * Xlib headers (optional)

  You can compile the daemon without Xlib, but it won't be compatible with
  applications that where written for the original proprietary 3Dconnexion
  driver (e.g. blender, maya, etc). The 3dxsrv compatibility interface needs to
  go through the X window system.

3. Installation
  If you have the dependencies installed, just run ``./configure'' and then
  ``make'' to compile the daemon, and ``make install'', to install it. The
  default installation prefix is ``/usr/local''. If you wish to install
  somewhere else, you may pass --prefix=/whatever to the configure script.

4. Running spacenavd
  If your system uses SysV init, then you may run the supplied ``setup_init''
  script, and everything should be set up to have spacenavd start automatically
  during system startup. However, for now, you won't have to reboot, just type
  ``/etc/init.d/spacenavd start'' as root, to start the daemon immediately.

  If your system uses BSD init (you can tell if you *don't* have a series of
  directories called rc0.d, rc1.d, and so on, in /etc), then you'll have to
  follow your init documentation and set this up yourself. You may be able to
  use the provided init_script file as a starting point.

5. Configuration
  The spacenavd daemon reads a number of options from the /etc/spnavrc file. If
  that file doesn't exist, then it uses default values for everything. You may
  use the graphical spnavcfg program to interactively set any of these options.
  The daemon should respond immediately to your changes, and also the
  configuration file should be updated automatically.
  An example configuration file is included in the doc subdirectory.

6. Troubleshooting
  If you're having trouble running spacenavd, read the up to date FAQ on the
  spacenav website: http://spacenav.sourceforge.net/faq.html

  If you're still having trouble, send a description of your problem to the
  spacenav-users mailing list: spacenav-users@lists.sourceforge.net
  along with a copy of your /var/log/spnavd.log and any other relevant
  information.
